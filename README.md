# 📐 Numerical Interpolation in C

This repository contains basic **numerical interpolation methods** implemented in **C**. These are part of my learning and exploration in numerical methods and computational mathematics.

## 🧮 Implemented Methods

- **Lagrange Interpolation**
- **Newton Forward Interpolation**
- **Newton Backward Interpolation**
- **Newton’s Divided Difference Method**

More methods may be added as I explore further.
